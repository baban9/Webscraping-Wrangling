# Webscraping-Wrangling

This is a pilot project to extract tweets and create insights about the users and tweets sentiments. 

Through this pilot project, We can essentially unserstand the trend of the query being perceived into the twitter users world. 
With a reach of 330 million users, it has an immense power to capture the attention through various practices namely, hashtags, advertisements, etc. 

While performing certain tasks, the higher lever of understanding is that, eventually passing just the query and number of tweets this approach will give the time cummulative opinion of the query.

It will also give us insights of any patterns recognizable during the time frame.

I hope this mini-project gives few insights, which further can be translated into bigger solutions.
